## Inspiration

This component was inspired by a design shared on X (formerly Twitter) by [@ayushsoni_io](https://x.com/ayushsoni_io/status/1985645474771321194). The original design featured a clean, fluid asset preview card with an elegant morphing action menu.

## Features

- **Fluid morphing animation** - The link button smoothly transforms into a dropdown menu using Framer Motion's `layoutId`
- **Smooth transitions** - All interactions use spring-based animations for natural feel
- **Accessible** - Full keyboard support (Escape to close) and ARIA labels
- **Responsive** - Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining visual hierarchy
- **Customizable** - Supports thumbnails, file types, and custom actions

## Usage

<CodeBlock
	code={`import { FluidAssetPreview } from '@/craft/components/fluid-asset-preview';

<FluidAssetPreview
  fileName="document.pdf"
  fileDate="January 15, 2024"
  thumbnailUrl="/path/to/thumbnail.png"
  fileType="pdf"
  onLinkClick={() => console.log('Link clicked')}
/>`}
	language='tsx'
/>

## Design Notes

The component features a unique split design:
- **Left side**: Contains the thumbnail and file information with a rounded left edge
- **Right side**: Action buttons with a fluid connection using CSS clip-path for the curved edge

The dropdown menu uses Framer Motion's layout animation to create a seamless morphing effect from the link button, creating a delightful micro-interaction that feels natural and polished.
